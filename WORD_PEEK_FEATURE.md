## 🎯 Feature Description

### Problem Solved
During active gameplay (after the initial 3-second word reveal), presenters sometimes forget the word they need to perform. This feature provides a quick way to peek at the word again without disrupting the game flow.

### Solution Implemented
- **Clickable Category Badge**: The category badge (DRAW/EXPLAIN/SIGNAL) becomes a clickable button
- **5-Second Reveal**: Clicking shows the word for exactly 5 seconds
- **Visual Countdown**: Clear countdown timer shows when word will hide again
- **Eye Icon Indicator**: 👁️ icon indicates the peek functionality
- **Seamless UX**: Smooth transitions and category-colored design

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **During Gameplay** (after initial word reveal)
   ```
   Normal state:
   - Category badge shows: "👁️ DRAW" / "👁️ EXPLAIN" / "👁️ SIGNAL"
   - Badge is clickable with hover effect
   - Category color-coded (Blue/Green/Orange)
   ```

2. **Click to Peek**
   ```
   User clicks category badge
   → Word instantly appears in badge
   → Shows: "👁️ TORONY" (example word)
   → Countdown appears below: "Hiding in 5s..."
   ```

3. **Countdown**
   ```
   Timer counts down: 5s → 4s → 3s → 2s → 1s
   → Word automatically hides after 5 seconds
   → Badge returns to category name: "👁️ DRAW"
   → Ready to peek again if needed
   ```

4. **Multiple Peeks**
   ```
   - Can peek multiple times during a round
   - Each peek lasts exactly 5 seconds
   - No cooldown between peeks
   - No penalty for using peek feature
   ```

## 📋 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### **`/src/components/game/GamePlay.tsx`**

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [showWordPeek, setShowWordPeek] = useState(false);
const [peekTimeLeft, setPeekTimeLeft] = useState(5);
const peekTimerRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
```

**Peek Timer useEffect:**
```typescript
// Handle word peek timer (5 seconds)
useEffect(() => {
  if (showWordPeek && peekTimeLeft > 0) {
    peekTimerRef.current = setInterval(() => {
      setPeekTimeLeft(prev => {
        if (prev <= 1) {
          setShowWordPeek(false);
          setPeekTimeLeft(5);
          if (peekTimerRef.current) clearInterval(peekTimerRef.current);
          return 5;
        }
        return prev - 1;
      });
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      if (peekTimerRef.current) clearInterval(peekTimerRef.current);
    };
  }
}, [showWordPeek, peekTimeLeft]);
```

**Peek Handler Function:**
```typescript
// Function to handle word peek
const handleWordPeek = () => {
  if (!showWordPeek && !showWord) {
    setShowWordPeek(true);
    setPeekTimeLeft(5);
  }
};
```

**Updated UI - Clickable Badge:**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={handleWordPeek}
  className="inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full text-white font-bold text-lg shadow-lg hover:opacity-90 transition-opacity active:scale-95"
  style={{ backgroundColor: categoryColor }}
>
  {showWordPeek ? '👁️ ' + currentWord.text.toUpperCase() : '👁️ ' + game.currentCategory.toUpperCase()}
</button>
{showWordPeek && (
  <div className="mt-2 text-sm font-semibold" style={{ color: categoryColor }}>
    Hiding in {peekTimeLeft}s...
  </div>
)}
```

## 🎨 Design Details

### Visual Design

**Normal State:**
- Badge shows: **"👁️ DRAW"** / **"👁️ EXPLAIN"** / **"👁️ SIGNAL"**
- Background color: Category-specific (Blue/Green/Orange)
- Eye icon (👁️) indicates clickability
- Hover effect: Opacity reduces to 90%
- Active effect: Slight scale down (scale-95)

**Peeking State:**
- Badge shows: **"👁️ TORONY"** (actual word in UPPERCASE)
- Same category-colored background
- Countdown text appears below: **"Hiding in 5s..."**
- Countdown text color: Category-colored
- Smooth transition between states

### Interactive Elements

**Button Interactions:**
```css
/* Hover state */
hover:opacity-90

/* Active/clicked state */
active:scale-95

/* Smooth transitions */
transition-opacity
```

**Countdown Feedback:**
- Clear, readable text (text-sm font-semibold)
- Category-colored for visual consistency
- Updates every second (5s → 4s → 3s → 2s → 1s)
- Positioned directly below badge (mt-2)

## ⚙️ Technical Features

### Timer Management

**Proper Interval Cleanup:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (showWordPeek && peekTimeLeft > 0) {
    peekTimerRef.current = setInterval(() => {
      // Timer logic
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      if (peekTimerRef.current) clearInterval(peekTimerRef.current);
    };
  }
}, [showWordPeek, peekTimeLeft]);
```

**Auto-Reset:**
- Timer automatically resets to 5 seconds after hiding
- Prevents state issues with multiple peeks
- Clean interval management with useRef

### State Protection

**Conditional Peek:**
```typescript
const handleWordPeek = () => {
  if (!showWordPeek && !showWord) {  // Only allow peek during gameplay
    setShowWordPeek(true);
    setPeekTimeLeft(5);
  }
};
```

**Prevents:**
- Peeking during initial 3-second word reveal
- Multiple simultaneous peek timers
- State conflicts with other timers

3. **Word Appears:**
   - Badge now shows: "👁️ YOUR_WORD"
   - Below it: "Hiding in 5s..."
   - **Memorize the word quickly!**

4. **Word Hides Automatically:**

5. **Peek Again If Needed:**
   - You can click again anytime
   - Each peek lasts 5 seconds
   - No limits or penalties

### Tips:
