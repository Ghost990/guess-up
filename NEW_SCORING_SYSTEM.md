## 📋 Technical Implementation

### File Changes

#### 1. **`/src/types/game.ts`**

Added new properties to `Game` interface:

```typescript
/** Current question number in round (1-indexed) */
currentQuestionInRound: number;

/** Questions per round (default 10) */
questionsPerRound: number;
```

#### 2. **`/src/stores/gameStore.ts`**

**Updated `setupGame` function:**
- Initialize `currentQuestionInRound: 1`
- Initialize `questionsPerRound: 10`

**Updated `endRound` signature:**
```typescript
endRound: (success: boolean, guesserId?: string) => void;
```

**New Scoring Logic:**
```typescript
if (success && guesserId) {
  const updatedPlayers = players.map((p) => {
    if (p.id === players[game.currentPlayerIndex].id) {
      return { ...p, score: p.score + 2 }; // Presenter +2
    }
    if (p.id === guesserId) {
      return { ...p, score: p.score + 1 }; // Guesser +1
    }
    return p;
  });
}
```

**New Round Progression:**
```typescript
const nextQuestionInRound = game.currentQuestionInRound + 1;

if (nextQuestionInRound > game.questionsPerRound) {
  // Round complete, move to next player
  const nextPlayerIndex = (game.currentPlayerIndex + 1) % players.length;
  const nextRound = game.currentRound + 1;
  // ... game over or next round logic
} else {
  // Continue with next question in same round
  currentQuestionInRound: nextQuestionInRound
}
```

#### 3. **`/src/components/game/GamePlay.tsx`**

**New State:**
```typescript
const [showPlayerSelect, setShowPlayerSelect] = useState(false);
const otherPlayers = players.filter((_, index) => index !== game?.currentPlayerIndex);
```

**Updated Button:**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => setShowPlayerSelect(true)}
  className="px-6 py-4 rounded-lg font-bold text-lg text-white shadow-lg"
  style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--color-success)' }}
>
  ✓ Got It!
</button>
```

**New Player Selection Modal:**
```typescript
{showPlayerSelect && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center p-6 z-50">
    <div className="bg-white rounded-2xl p-6 max-w-md w-full shadow-2xl">
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-center">
        Who guessed it?
      </h3>
      <div className="space-y-3 mb-4">
        {otherPlayers.map((player) => (
          <button
            key={player.id}
            onClick={() => {
              endRound(true, player.id);
              setShowPlayerSelect(false);
            }}
            className="w-full px-6 py-4 rounded-lg font-bold text-lg text-white shadow-lg"
            style={{ backgroundColor: categoryColor }}
          >
            {player.name}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
      <button
        onClick={() => setShowPlayerSelect(false)}
        className="w-full px-6 py-3 rounded-lg font-semibold text-sm"
        style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--color-muted)' }}
      >
        Cancel
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Enhanced Question Counter:**
```typescript
<div className="text-sm font-semibold" style={{ color: categoryColor }}>
  Question {game.currentQuestionInRound} / {game.questionsPerRound}
</div>
```
